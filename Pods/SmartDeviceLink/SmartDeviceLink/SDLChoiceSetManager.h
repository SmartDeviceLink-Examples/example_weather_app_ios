 Present a choice set on the head unit with a certain interaction mode.

Use Both if you're lazy...for real though, it's kind of confusing to the user and isn't recommended.

 This presents the choice set as searchable when in a touch interaction. The user, when not in a distracted state, will have a keyboard available for searching this set. The user's input in the keyboard will be available in the SDLKeyboardDelegate.

 If the cells in the set are not already preloaded, they will be preloaded before the presentation occurs; this could take a while depending on the contents of the cells.

 If the cells have voice commands and images attached, this could take upwards of 10 seconds. If there are no cells on the set, this will fail, calling `choiceSet:didReceiveError:` on the choice set delegate.

 @param choiceSet The set to be displayed
