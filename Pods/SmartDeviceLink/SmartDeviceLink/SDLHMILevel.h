/**
 * Specifies current level of the HMI. An HMI level indicates the degree of user interaction possible through the HMI (e.g. TTS only, display only, VR, etc.). The HMI level varies for an application based on the type of display (i.e. Nav or non-Nav) and the user directing "focus" to other applications (e.g. phone, other mobile applications, etc.). Used in OnHMIStatus
