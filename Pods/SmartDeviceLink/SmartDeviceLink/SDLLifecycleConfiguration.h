 Which transports are permitted to be used as secondary transports. A secondary transport is a transport that is connected as an alternate, higher bandwidth transport for situations when a low-bandwidth primary transport (such as Bluetooth) will restrict certain features (such as video streaming navigation).

 The only currently available secondary transport is TCP over WiFi. This is set to permit TCP by default, but it can be disabled by using SDLSecondaryTransportsNone instead.

 This will only affect apps that have high-bandwidth requirements; currently that is only video streaming navigation apps.
