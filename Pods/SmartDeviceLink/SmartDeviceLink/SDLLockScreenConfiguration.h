 *  Whether or not the lock screen should be shown in the "lock screen optional" state. Defaults to false.

 *  @discussion In order for the "lock screen optional" state to occur, the following must be true:
 *  1. The app should have received at least 1 driver distraction notification (i.e. a `OnDriverDistraction` notification) from SDL Core. Older versions of Core did not send a notification immediately on connection.
 *  2. The driver is not distracted (i.e. the last `OnDriverDistraction` notification received was for a driver distraction state off).
 *  3. The `hmiLevel` can not be `NONE`.
 *  4. If the `hmiLevel` is currently `BACKGROUND` then the previous `hmiLevel` should have been `FULL` or `LIMITED` (i.e. the user should have interacted with app before it was backgrounded).
