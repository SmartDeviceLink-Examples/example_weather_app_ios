NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

/// This is the first `viewController` set in the lock screen's `UIWindow`. It's purpose is to fix an Apple bug where having a `UIWindow` (it does not even need to be active, simply created) can break the app's view controller based rotation. This bug lets the status/home bars rotate even if the view controller only supports one orientation.
