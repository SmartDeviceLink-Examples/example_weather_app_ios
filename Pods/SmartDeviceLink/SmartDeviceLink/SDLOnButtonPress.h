/**
 * Notifies application of button press events for buttons to which the
 * application is subscribed. SDL supports two button press events defined as
 * follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>SHORT - Occurs when a button is depressed, then released within two
 * seconds. The event is considered to occur immediately after the button is
 * released.</li>
 * <li>LONG - Occurs when a button is depressed and held for two seconds or
 * more. The event is considered to occur immediately after the two second
 * threshold has been crossed, before the button is released</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>HMI Status Requirements:</b>
 * <ul>
 * HMILevel:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The application will receive OnButtonPress notifications for all
 * subscribed buttons when HMILevel is FULL.</li>
 * <li>The application will receive OnButtonPress notifications for subscribed
 * media buttons when HMILevel is LIMITED.</li>
 * <li>Media buttons include SEEKLEFT, SEEKRIGHT, TUNEUP, TUNEDOWN, and
 * PRESET_0-PRESET_9.</li>
 * <li>The application will not receive OnButtonPress notification when HMILevel
 * is BACKGROUND or NONE.</li>
 * </ul>
 * AudioStreamingState:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Any </li>
 * </ul>
 * SystemContext:
 * <ul>
 * <li>MAIN, VR. In MENU, only PRESET buttons. In VR, pressing any subscribable
 * button will cancel VR.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
