/**
 * Notifies an application that HMI conditions have changed for the application. This indicates whether the application
 * can speak phrases, display text, perform interactions, receive button presses and events, stream audio, etc. This
 * notification will be sent to the application when there has been a change in any one or several of the indicated
 * states (<i>SDLHMILevel</i>, <i>SDLAudioStreamingState</i> or <i>SDLSystemContext</i>) for the application.
 *
 * All three values are, in principle, independent of each other (though there may be some relationships). A value for
 * one parameter should not be interpreted from the value of another parameter.
 *
 * There are no guarantees about the timeliness or latency of the SDLOnHMIStatus notification. Therefore, for example,
 * information such as <i>SDLAudioStreamingState</i> may not indicate that the audio stream became inaudible to the user
 * exactly when the SDLOnHMIStatus notification was received.
