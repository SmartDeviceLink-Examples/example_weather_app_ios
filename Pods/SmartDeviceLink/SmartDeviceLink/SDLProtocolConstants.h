/**
 *  The data packet's header and payload combination.

 - SDLFrameTypeControl: Lowest-level type of packets. They can be sent over any of the defined services. They are used for the control of the services in which they are sent.
 - SDLFrameTypeSingle: Contains all the data for a particular packet in the payload. The majority of frames sent over the protocol utilize this frame type.
 - SDLFrameTypeFirst: The First Frame in a multiple frame payload contains information about the entire sequence of frames so that the receiving end can correctly parse all the frames and reassemble the entire payload. The payload of this frame is only eight bytes and contains information regarding the rest of the sequence.
 - SDLFrameTypeConsecutive: The Consecutive Frames in a multiple frame payload contain the actual raw data of the original payload. The parsed payload contained in each of the Consecutive Frames' payloads should be buffered until the entire sequence is complete.

/**
 *  The data packet's format and priority.

 - SDLServiceTypeControl: The lowest level service available.
 - SDLServiceTypeRPC: Used to send requests, responses, and notifications between an application and a head unit.
 - SDLServiceTypeAudio: The application can start the audio service to send PCM audio data to the head unit. After the StartService packet is sent and the ACK received, the payload for the Audio Service is only PCM audio data.
 - SDLServiceTypeVideo: The application can start the video service to send H.264 video data to the head unit. After the StartService packet is sent and the ACK received, the payload for the Video Service is only H.264 video data.
 - SDLServiceTypeBulkData: Similar to the RPC Service but adds a bulk data field. The payload of a message sent via the Hybrid service consists of a Binary Header, JSON Data, and Bulk Data.

 - SDLFrameInfoStartServiceNACK: Negatively acknowledges that the specific service was not started.
