/**
 * Registers the application's interface with SDL&reg;, declaring properties of
 * the registration, including the messaging interface version, the app name,
 * etc. The mobile application must establish its interface registration with
 * SDL before any other interaction with SDL&reg; can take place. The
 * registration lasts until it is terminated either by the application calling
 * the <i> SDLUnregisterAppInterface</i> method, or by SDL&reg;
 * sending an <i> SDLOnAppInterfaceUnregistered</i> notification, or
 * by loss of the underlying transport connection, or closing of the underlying
 * message transmission protocol RPC session
 * <p>
 * Until the application receives its first <i>SDLOnHMIStatus</i>
 * Notification, its HMI Status is assumed to be: <i>
 * SDLHMILevel</i>=NONE, <i>
 * SDLAudioStreamingState
 * </i>=NOT_AUDIBLE, <i>
 * SDLSystemContext</i>=MAIN
 * <p>
 * All SDL&reg; resources which the application creates or uses (e.g. Choice
 * Sets, Command Menu, etc.) are associated with the application's interface
 * registration. Therefore, when the interface registration ends, the SDL&reg;
 * resources associated with the application are disposed of. As a result, even
 * though the application itself may continue to run on its host platform (e.g.
 * mobile device) after the interface registration terminates, the application
 * will not be able to use the SDL&reg; HMI without first establishing a new
 * interface registration and re-creating its required SDL&reg; resources. That
 * is, SDL&reg; resources created by (or on behalf of) an application do not
 * persist beyond the life-span of the interface registration
 * <p>
 * Resources and settings whose lifespan is tied to the duration of an
 * application's interface registration:<br/>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Choice Sets</li>
 * <li>Command Menus (built by successive calls to <i>SDLAddCommand
 * </i>)</li>
 * <li>Media clock timer display value</li>
 * <li>Media clock timer display value</li>
 * <li>Media clock timer display value</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The autoActivateID is used to grant an application the HMILevel and
 * AudioStreamingState it had when it last disconnected
 * <p>
 * <b>Notes: </b>The autoActivateID parameter, and associated behavior, is
 * currently ignored by SDL&reg;
 * <p>
 * When first calling this method (i.e. first time within life cycle of mobile
 * app), an autoActivateID should not be included. After successfully
 * registering an interface, an autoActivateID is returned to the mobile
 * application for it to use in subsequent connections. If the connection
 * between SDL&reg; and the mobile application is lost, such as the vehicle is
 * turned off while the application is running, the autoActivateID can then be
 * passed in another call to RegisterAppInterface to re-acquire <i>
 * SDLHMILevel</i>=FULL
 * <p>
 * If the application intends to stream audio it is important to indicate so via
 * the isMediaApp parameter. When set to true, audio will reliably stream
 * without any configuration required by the user. When not set, audio may
 * stream, depending on what the user might have manually configured as a media
 * source on SDL&reg;
 * <p>
 * There is no time limit for how long the autoActivateID is "valid" (i.e. would
 * confer focus and opt-in)
 * <p>
 * <b>HMILevel is not defined before registering</b><br/>
 * </p>
